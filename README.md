# Fast OSM Extraction

Workflows for performant extraction of entities from OSM protobuf (.pbf) files with various tools like DuckDB spatial and Rust-based OSM pbf readers.

Aim: Extract all roads with ongoing construction fast and export to geoparquet/pmtiles or other file formats.

## ðŸ¥‡ 1 DuckDB spatial: 4:12 minutes for planet.pbf (incl. post-processing) ðŸ‘‘

The whole idea revolves around DuckDB spatial's `st_readOSM()` function (I stumbled upon on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40891644)) that can directly read a pbf file. And no, you do not need tons of RAM! I actually tested it with 16Gb max RAM usage vs 96Gb and it had no effect on the processing time; literally none (not even a few seconds or so). Maybe I did something wrong, but considering it works so beautifully, I won't investigate further. 

Have a look at the attached Jupyter Notebook I used for convenience. You might even squeeze some more seconds performance out of DuckDB if it's not wrapped in Python.

Extracting all entities from Germany took only **13.3 seconds**! 

## ðŸ¥ˆ 2 Osmium tool: 7 minutes for planet.pbf (without post-processing)

Osmium (C++ based) could preprocess the planet file so all consecutive processing becomes faster. However, only this reduction already took 7 mins and turned my Mac into a helicopter.
Considering that Osmium is inferior, I didn't even continue this workflow but instead looked a little closer at Rust-based OSM Pbd-Readers as alternative.

```shell
time osmium tags-filter \
    planet-250602.osm.pbf \
    w/highway,construction \
    -o construction-roads.osm.pbf \
    --overwrite
[======================================================================] 100%
osmium tags-filter planet-250602.osm.pbf w/highway,construction -o    2964.27s user 153.42s system 736% cpu 7:03.38 total
```

### ðŸ¥‰ Osmpbfreader-rs (without post-processing)

I had high expectations but was disappointed. Trying to wrestle with the compiler and ever-changing APIs in the Rust ecosystem with dependency issues really gave me headaches. Also, unfortunately the geo ecosystem on Rust is underdeveloped. E.g. GeoPolars is stale: 

> Update (August 2024): GeoPolars is [blocked](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/1830#issuecomment-2218102856) on Polars supporting [Arrow extension types](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/9112), which would allow GeoPolars to persist geometry type information and coordinate reference system (CRS) metadata. It's not feasible to create a `geopolars.GeoDataFrame` as a subclass of a `polars.DataFrame` (similar to how the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` is a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame`) because polars explicitly [does not support subclassing of core data types](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/2846#issuecomment-1711799869). See https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars/pull/240.

I ended up writing a short script that only read the data to an array as all the downstream tasks like persisting to geoparquet turned out to be too time-consuming for now. The speed was ok-ish: 

####  Germany only 48 seconds

```bash
time ./target/release/osm-construction-extractor --input ../germany-latest.osm.pbf
```

```bash

âœ… Success! Data is held in an in-memory array.

Example of first extracted way:
ConstructionWay {
    id: WayId(
        3358460,
    ),
    tags: {
        "highway": "construction",
        "bicycle": "yes",
        "name": "Paul-Stritter-Weg",
        "surface": "paving_stones",
        "construction": "footway",

        "lit": "yes",
    },

}

```

#### Planet


```bash
time ./target/release/osm-construction-extractor --input ../planet-250602.osm.pbf 
```

Aborted the run after 15 minutes. Not useful to measure the performance at this point.

### Other contenders

- [planetiler](https://github.com/b-r-u/osmpbf) - used it to create a protomaps/basemap once, and took roughly 2h, strong contender, also for convenience as it can export dircetly to mbtiles or pmtiles
- [osmpbf](https://github.com/b-r-u/osmpbf) - Rust-based too, haven't tried yet
